# BE-CALF
BE-CALF: Bit-Depth Enhancement by Concatenating All Level Features of DNN

# Instructions: 
1) install TensorFlow(GPU);
2) run 4-16/test_416.py to recover 16-bit images from 4-bit versions.\
   run 8-16/test_816.py to recover 16-bit images from 8-bit versions.\
   It will directly compress and reconstruct images from test/.
3) Results output to results_416/ or results_816/.
* The image size in the code needs to be changed.
